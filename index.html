        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown in the user.</li>
          <li>The body element is an example of a semantic HTML element, which makes your HTML easier to read by other developers and the browser.</li>
          <li>User semantic elements whenever possible.</li>
          <li>The [h1], [h2], [h3], [h4], [h5], and [h6] elements represent the level of heading.</li>
          <li>The [p] element represents a paragraph or block of text to wrap most of the text on webpages.</li>
          <li>The [ul], [ol], and [li] elements represent underdered lists, ordered lists, and list items (bulleted or numbered).</li>
          <li>The [img] element contains information about images that are displayed on the webpage, where the "src=" attribute defines the location of the image.</li>
          <li>The [br] element creates a line of empty space or line break.</li>
          <li>The [a] element stands for anchor and creates links to the same webpage or other webpages, while the "href=" attribute points to the URL for the link.</li>
          <li>The [main] element holds the text data associated with the body.</li>
          <li>The [footer] appears at the bottom of the page and usually contains the author, copyright, contact, sitemap, and navigation and contains the [p] element</li>
          <li>Code can be commented out using the /* and *l in the line before and after the code in question.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A period preceeding verbiage in the CSS file designates this as a class selector, so any HTML element assigned to this class will gain the property assignments from the CSS file.</li>
          <li>The asterisk enables you to select all elements of a particular selector, so if you used *p it would allow all elements in your document with the "p" HTML tag to be assigned a particula style.</p></li>

      <section class="card" id="git-section">
        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on.</li>
          <li>git checkout: switch to another branch and check it to your working directory.</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it.</li>
          <li>git add -A: Add changed files in our working directory to the staging area of Git, but make sure you're in the feature branch.</li>
          <li>git commit -m "descriptive message": commit your staged content as a new commit snapshot.</li>
          <li>git pull origin main: make's sure the current branch is up to date before opening a pull request.</li>
          <li> git push origin feature/name: transmit local branch commits to remote repository branch.</li>
          <li>Once pushed, you can navigate to the repository on GitHub, clock the "Pull Requests" tab and then the "New Pull Request" button.  The base branch should be "main" and the comparison branch should be the feature branch to be merged.  Add a title for the pull request with a description of the changes, click "Create pull request" button, then merge the comparison branch into the base branch by selecting the "Merge pull request" button and confirming the merge request.</li>
          <li>The "Issues" tab can then be accessed in GitHub and the "Close issue" button can be used if the issue has been resolved.</li>
          <li>Once the merge has been completed, update our local branch by  going to the command line, type "git checkout main", then pull the remote main branch into the local main branch by entering "git pull origin main".</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A function is simply a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task.</li>
          <li>A function is different from a FOR loop or conditional statement because functions do not automatically execute when the JavaScript file (.js) is run.
          <li>You must call a function in order to execute it and a function's name is always followed by parentheses - function helloWorld().</li>
          </li>The code to be executed is written inside curly brackets { }<li>
          <li>A JavaScript file is read from top to bottom.</li>
          <li>It is common practice to indent the "for" loop code below the function name, within the curly brackets for visual structure.</li>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>When we declare a function in our JavaScript code, we are creating a reusable block of code that performs a specific task</li>
          <li>We need to call the function in the code at the spot we want it to execute.</li>
          <li>To call a function, we use the name of the function in our JavaScript file where we want the code to execute.</li>
          <li>Functions can be created for both "for" and "if" statements.</li>
